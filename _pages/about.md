I am a second year PhD student in the [Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE)](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) department at Princeton University, co-advised by Prof. [Amir Ali Ahmadi](https://aaa.princeton.edu/) and Prof. [Bartolomeo Stellato](https://stellato.io/). 

My research focuses on mathematical optimization, with various applications in machine learning, graph theory, etc. Specifically, my prior research incorporates a convex perspective to the neural network training. Currently, I am working on polynomial opimization and have proposed a disjunctive sum of squares method to certiy nonnegativity of polynomials with multiple low-degree algebraic identities. (Coming soon on arXiv)

I completed my undergraduate degree at the School of Mathematical Science, Peking University.
